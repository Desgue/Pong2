# Pong2: My First Game Development Project

Welcome to Pong2, my inaugural game development endeavor! This project showcases the classic Pong experience with an exciting twist – a dynamic difficulty adjustment. As you score points, get ready for surprises: your paddle might shrink, your opponent's paddle could grow, or the ball may speed up. Can you overcome these challenges and emerge victorious?

## Features:

- Classic Pong gameplay with a dynamic difficulty mechanic.
- Four game states: Initial screen, gameplay, pause, and game over.
- Smooth controls using the keyboard.
- A challenging "AI" opponent that cleverly tracks the ball's position.

## Tech Stack:

- **Programming Language:** Python 3
- **Game Library:** Pygame-ce

## How to Play:

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries: `pip install pygame-ce`.
3. Run `main.py` to embark on your Pong2 journey.
4. Control your paddle with the up and down arrow keys.
5. Score points by hitting the ball past your opponent.
6. Brace yourself – the difficulty intensifies with each point scored.
   - Either the ball gets faster, or your paddle get smaller and the enemies gets bigger at each point you score.
8. Navigate through screens using the P key (pause) and SPACE key (unpause).

## Additional Notes:

- There is no restart command; use the SPACE key to unpause.
- The game includes a highscore count, stored in a JSON file.

Feel free to explore, experiment, and enjoy your Pong2 experience!
